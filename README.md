send-echo-request
=================

`send-echo-request` sends one ICMP (IPv4) or ICMPv6 echo request each
to a list of addresses without waiting for the echo reply packets. A
packet is sent every 0.5 seconds. Optionally, sending the packets is
repeated in an infinite loop.

As `send-echo-request` does not wait for or evaluate any echo reply
packets, processing the received reply packets must be done in another
place, e.g. in `iptables` like my
[someone else is using the internet LED (YUP LED)](http://n-dimensional.de/blog/2014/07/04/led-configuration-with-openwrt/)
setup does.

`send-echo-request` has been designed and developed on and for use on
GNU/Linux (Fedora) and uClibc/Linux (OpenWRT). On other systems, YMMV.

Running `send-echo-request` should be easy enough:

    # ./send-echo-request --help
    # ./send-echo-request -vv --loop ::1 127.0.0.1
    # ./send-echo-request -q  --loop 192.168.1.23 192.168.1.42

`send-echo-request` is licensed under GPLv2+, i.e. GNU GPL version 2 or
(at your option) any later version. Read the LICENSE file for details.


Building and installing, generic Linux edition
----------------------------------------------

This requires GNU `make` and `gcc` and possible a few more things I
forgot to list here.

Building `send-echo-request` should be easy:

    $ make

If you want to run `send-echo-request` as a non-root user, you need to
give the executable the required set of capabilities:

    # setcap "cap_net_raw=ep" send-echo-request

The complete `cap_net_raw=ep cap_net_admin=ep` capability set often
used for `iputils`' `ping` and `ping6` executables appears not to be
required for `send-echo-request` more limited feature set.

For installation using GNU `make`, you can optionally define `DESTDIR`
and `bindir`, and then run

    make install
	make uninstall


Building and installing, embedded/OpenWRT hack edition
------------------------------------------------------

After
[setting up an OpenWRT buildroot](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/build)
and building at least the toolchain part of it, you can build
`send-echo-requestÂ´ like

    make clean
    make STAGING_DIR="\$(HOME)/src/openwrt-build/12.09/staging_dir" CC="\$(STAGING_DIR)/toolchain-i386_gcc-4.6-linaro_uClibc-0.9.33.2/bin/i486-openwrt-linux-uclibc-gcc"
	strip send-echo-request

The stripping part reduces the file size from ~20K to ~8K. (Yes, the
strip utility should really be from the OpenWRT buildroot toolchain.)

After copying the `send-echo-request` executable over to the OpenWRT
host, it should be available for use:

	scp send-echo-request openwrt_host:/bin/

(Yes, this is a hack: No IPKG software package. Using
non-crosscompile-strip tool. However, it works for me. YMMV.)
